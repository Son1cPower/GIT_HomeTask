Money, money, money, money...

Loh-woach-ove!

Love is just
A history that they may prove.
And when you're gone,
I'll tell them my religion's you.

When Punk-tius comes
To kill the king upon his throne.
I'm ready for their stones.

I'll dance, dance, dance,
With my hands, hands, hands,
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said.

I'm gonna dance, dance, dance,
With my hands, hands, hands,
Above my head, dance together.
Forgive him before he's dead because

I won't cry for you.
I won't crucify the things you do.
I won't cry for you, see,
When you're gone
I'll still be Bloody Mary.

(Love!)

We are not,
Just art for Michaelangelo to carve.
He can't rewrite the agro of my furied heart.

I'll wait,
On mountain tops in Paris cold.
J'ai peur,
Mourir toute seule.

I'll dance, dance, dance,
With my hands, hands, hands,
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said.

I'm gonna dance, dance, dance,
With my hands, hands, hands,
Above my head, dance together.
Forgive him before he's dead because

I won't cry for you,
I won't crucify the things you do.
I won't cry for you, see (Gaga)
When you're gone (Gaga)
I'll still be Bloody Mary. (Gaga, Gaga)

(Love, love!)

Gaga, Gaga, Gaga, Gaga,
Gaga, Gaga, Gaga, Gaga.

Dum, dum, da, da, da,
Dum, dum, da, da, da,
Da, da, da, da,
Dum, dum, da, da, da!

Dum, dum, da, da, da,
Dum, dum, da, da, da,
Da, da, da, da,
Dum, dum, da, da, da!

I won't cry for you,
I won't crucify the things you do, do, do!
I won't cry for you, see,(Gaga)
When you're gone (Gaga)
I'll still be Bloody Mary! (Gaga, Gaga)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! (Gaga)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! (Gaga)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! (Gaga)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! (Gaga)
